List Initialization: An empty list lis is created to store tasks.
User Input for Tasks: A for loop runs 6 times, prompting the user to input tasks which are appended to lis.
Task Completion Check: Another for loop iterates over lis, prompting the user to input the index of a completed task or enter 10 if no task is completed.
Break Condition: If the user inputs 10, the loop breaks, stopping further checks.
Deleting Completed Tasks: If a valid index is entered, the corresponding task is removed from lis.
Remaining Tasks Display: Finally, the remaining tasks in lis are printed.
